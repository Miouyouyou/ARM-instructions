This project currently provides all the variants of several ARM assembly mnemonics, with descriptions of these mnemonics and variants.

The final goal is to provide :
- all the keywords and mnemonics described in the official ARM architecture manuals;
- all the encodings of each instruction, as described in the same manuals;
in formats that can easily be interpreted by programs.

Currently, the only available format is JSON. XML will be next.

The current main point is to be able to generate configuration files for syntax highlighters tools like Rouge, in order to highlight ARM assembly scripts presented on webpages.
